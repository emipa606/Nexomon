Q: Can this mod be added to existing save file?
A: Yes

Q: is this mod Compatible with Combat Extended?
A: I don't use CE and will no make patches for it. It's not compatible with CE combat system, and gives some errors. 
     However it can be safely added without crashing. (except a few errors)

Q: How strong are the Nexomon compared to vanilla animals?
A: Nexomon are fairly tough, don't fight them unless you have a decent amount of firepower.

Q: Could you add x?
A: Feel free to share any ideas. If it sounds fun and do-able I would add it in.
